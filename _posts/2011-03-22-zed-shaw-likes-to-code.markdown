While I found this site very entertaining, Zed is missing an important word: it's not just _programming_ that's important, it's _useful programming_. And how do we do useful programming? Well, that's what all the processes and methodologies we use are for. Without them we're using hammers to hit screws, without realizing they're screws.

Interestingly, [Zed's blog post](http://oppugn.us/posts/1300784321.html) on the topic is much more reasonable. Perhaps he should update the main site...
