[Jeff Patton's keynote at AgileRoots 2010](http://confreaks.net/videos/44-agileroots2010-keynote-no-one-wants-your-stupid-processc) explains what he calls the "process racket". While off-the-shelf processes like Scrum and XP can help a team get started with agile, they are only a means to an end. That end being happy users, of course. Most of these processes focus on delivery, but they don't help us discover what our users need. Therefore, a good process needs to have a healthy balance of discovery and delivery.
