[In his usual style][ismerbrails], [Jason Seifer kindly asks us to quit fighting][source] about [CoffeeScript being integrated in Rails 3.1][tweet]. I was squarely in the anti-CoffeScript camp at first. My argument? It's just an abstraction on top of a language, and I'd rather just use the language itself. But then [Joe Cannatti][joec] reminded me that Ruby is merely an abstraction on top of C and C is an abstraction on top of assembler. Thinking about all the goodness Ruby provides has made me excited to try CoffeeScript (I haven't yet, but will soon).
