tweet: What's new in Rails 3.1?
---

In case you haven't heard, Rails 3.1 is right around the corner. I'm very excited for the built-in asset packaging and rendering engines for Javascript and CSS templates. The patterns they are recommending will help keep my static assets more organized without hurting client-side performance. [Ryan Bates (of Railscasts fame)][railscasts] has put together [a list of all the changes][source] coming in the next release of Rails. Along with the asset changes, Rails 3.1 sees built-in role support for ActiveRecord models to improve your app's security, jQuery as the default Javascript framework and much more. If you're interested in seeing it in action watch [Ryan's Rails 3.1 overview screencast][overview]. With this release, the Rails team has proven they want to stay ahead of the curve. My hope is that it will help us deliver more robust software faster.
