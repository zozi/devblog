tweet: Use Rubular for rapid feedback when writing regular expressions
---

Speaking of web-based tools to help you develop faster, [Rubular][] is a regex tester to help you build and test regular expressions without having to run your app. I use this when I'm troubleshooting tricky regular expressions. The way it splits out capture groups is very nice. My only complaint is that I can only test against one string at a time. I'd like to be able to put in a few test cases and see where it fails. Maybe I should write a test for that...
