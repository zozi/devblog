Recently I started reflecting on some of the tools, workflows and processes I use and whether or not they are actually helping me be more productive. But how do I know if they are making me more productive? We need to go deeper.

Decreasing time is pretty obvious, but value is subjective. What is value for a programmer? The most obvious definition is "the number of features completed over time". But when is a feature complete? When the tests pass? Sure, it's working, but how do you know you solved the problem correctly (or solved the correct problem)? The feature isn't done until the user tries it and says their problem is solved. Therefore, programmer productivity means solving the most problems to your user's satisfaction.
