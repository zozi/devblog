Here are [some helpful guidelines][1] for developers when you need to make UI decisions. My advice: if you have access to (or can hire) a designer, then use them! If you don't (or can't), then please spend some time up front talking to your target demographic (or someone similar) about what you are building and how it will solve their problem. When you finish a feature, go back to them and have them try it. I promise, it will be well worth it.
